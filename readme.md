# Plot choropleth map using R

This is a short demonstration example on how to use `R` and the `R` package `ggplot2` to produce a choropleth map. The geographic polygons are colored based on a statistic computed from a non GIS data source:

- **Geographic polygons**: political boundaries in Switzerland
- **The visualized statistic**: density of train stations (/km^2)


## How to run the code

In R, change the working directory to the root directory where this package is stored. Open and run `station-density-map-CH.R`.


## Data source

The data are from the Open Government Data site https://opendata.swiss. Details are found in the data directories.
